        This will use Sugar's `Bulk API`_ to batch all actions together and send them
        as a single HTTP request. It works similarly to :func:`asyncio.gather` in that
        this method will resolve once the result for all provided awaitables is
        available and return them as a tuple. You can also use this method to gather
        together multiple awaitables where only one of them uses the server. If an
        action doesn't resolve after the first request (for example because it needs a
        second one), a second batch will be started.

        Do not use this is threaded environments -- the implementation is not
        thread-safe.
